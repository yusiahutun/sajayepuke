Her has his next job lined up, and it’s not what you expect.</p><p>Seacrest became a co-host on Live With Kelly and Ryan in 2017 after <a href=# id=auto-tag_kelly-ripa data-tag=kelly-ripa>Kelly Ripa</a>‘s former co-host, Michael Strahan, left the show after four years in 2016. Seacrest is also an executive producer on the show. “Not only is Kelly Ripa one of the most talented live hosts in broadcast <a href=# id=auto-tag_tv data-tag=tv>TV</a>, she’s also become a very dear friend to me over the years. It’s consistently been my privilege and pleasure to work alongside Kelly with all her incredible talents, charm and humor – whether hosting the Disney Christmas Day Parade special with her a decade ago or guest co-hosting alongside her on ‘Live,’ it’s always just been easy and fun to share a set with her, and we have a blast,” Seacrest said in a statement at the time. “I’ve been so fortunate in my career to be a part of some incredible TV programs, and I’m excited to join daytime’s top entertainment talk show, and most important, I couldn’t think of anyone I’d rather share this new chapter with than Kelly Ripa – she’s a dream broadcast partner, and I can’t wait to start.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Ripa added in her own statement, “Ryan is a quintessential broadcaster and at the top of his game,” said Ripa. “I am thrilled to start my mornings with him every day, and we are so fortunate at ‘Live’ to have him join the family. Ryan is a close friend and his star shines as brightly off camera as it does on. His tremendous success is only matched by his impeccable reputation. Plainly said, everyone loves him, and so will our daily viewers.”</p><p>After six years, Seacrest announced he was leaving Live With Kelly and Ryan in February 2023. So..<a href=# rel=noopener>why is Ryan Seacrest leaving Live With Kelly and Ryan</a> and what will he do next? Read on for what we know about why Ryan Seacrest is leaving Live With Kelly and Ryan and who will replace him.</p><h2>Why is Ryan Seacrest leaving Live With Kelly and Ryan?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Live-With-Kelly-and-Ryan-2.jpg><p>Why is Ryan Seacrest leaving Live With Kelly and Ryan? Seacrest announced in an Instagram post on February 16, 2023, that he was leaving Live With Kelly and Ryan after almost six years as the daytime talk show’s co-host. “I’m going to miss my work wife and all the laughter we share,” he captioned a series of Instagram photos of him and his Live co-host, Kelly Ripa, over the years. “When I signed on to host Live in 2017 it was meant to be for 3 years, but I loved the job and working with Kelly so much that I extended my time and last year I made the decision to stay on for one more final season. I’ve been grateful to be able to share a cup of coffee with our viewers everyday, one of the best parts of the gig.”</p><p>In his post, Seacrest explained that he was leaving Live With Kelly and Ryan to focus on his jobs as the host of American Idol; his KIIS-FM radio show On Air with Ryan Seacrest; and Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve, as well as his charity, Ryan Seacrest Foundation Studios. He also confirmed he was replaced by Ripa’s husband, Mark Consuelos. “I’ll be transitioning out of Live this Spring to shoot the 21st season of American Idol in LA, continue my radio show on KIIS-FM and Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin Eve, and focus my summer on opening three more Ryan Seacrest Foundation Studios in pediatric hospitals across the country,” he wrote. “I’m looking forward to coming back to guest host in the future and Kelly, I promise to forever share my food photos, chicken eggs, and olive oil with you. And congratulations to my brother Mark, feel free to remodel my dressing room!”</p><p>Ripa also reacted to Seacrest’s exit news in her own Instagram post. “OK NOW we’re empty nesters. When your friends become work mates become family,” she captioned an Instagram photo of her and Seacrest. “Congratulations @ryanseacrest on surviving six winters in NYC! I’m proud of you and am forever in your corner. And @instasuelos welcome home, or to the contractual obligation phase of our relationship.”</p><p>So why is Ryan Seacrest leaving Live With Kelly and Ryan?&nbsp;A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> on February 16, 2023, of Seacrest’s announcement that he plans to move back to Los Angeles from New York City (where he moved to film Live With Kelly and Ryan) and plans to also start his own olive oil business. TMZ reported that Seacrest has his own property that produces olive oil and “it’s a passion that aligns with his passion for food.”</p><p>A source also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> on February 18, 2023, that exhaustion from hosting Live With Kelly, as well as On Air With Ryan Seacrest affected Seacrest’s decision to leave Live With Kelly and miss an increasing number of episodes leading up to his announcement. “Some of Ryan’s absences created tension with everyone involved on the show,” the insider said. “But everyone cares about him and respects him and just wants to make sure he’s OK.” The source also confirmed that Ripa was well aware of Seacrest’s plans to leave long before he announced it. “They started talking about Ryan leaving last summer, and when they announced Ryan’s departure, both Kelly and Ryan wanted to put whatever issues — arising from the workplace and Ryan’s other responsibilities — they had behind them,” the insider said. The source continued, “They’ve known each other for 20 years and, regardless of recent strains, it is a real friendship.”</p><p>Another source told Page Six that Seacrest found the schedule of Live With Kelly “punishing” and hated living in New York City. “It’s not just ‘Live.’ Ryan has to travel to audition cities for Idol — they just went to Hawaii. It’s exhausting,” the insider said. The source continued, “It is hard doing ‘Live’ every day. It’s a grueling schedule. There are double tapings and he runs between his radio show and Live. He’ll have a 10-minute break and they’ll say, ‘Come and do some one-liners for the radio show.’”</p><p>The source also explained that Seacrest’s priorities have shifted away from work in recent years. “He’s not quite burned out, but he knows himself [and knows] he needs a break. In the last couple of years he’s valued his time off with his family and his loved ones,” the insider said. “Look, he originally signed up for three years [on ‘Live’] and then signed another three-year contract, so he really did enjoy doing the show.”</p><p>The source also confirmed that Seacrest is interested in expanding into the food industry, making wine and olive oil, which he’s started pressing for friends from his own olive trees. “He’s really interested in learning how to make wine, he has a passion for cooking, and this is the kind of thing he wants to invest in,” the insider said.</p><p>A source also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Daily Mail</a> on February 21, 2023, that ABC, which airs Live With Kelly, was “eager” to replace him with Consuelos. “ABC has been eager to replace Seacrest with Mark,” the source said. “Mark and Kelly have TV magic. Viewers can’t get enough watching the sparks between them whenever he fills in for Ryan.” The insider continued, “They wanted to capitalize on that, so there weren’t exactly tears shed when Ryan started talking about leaving.”</p><p>The source explained that Consuelos had been on ABC’s radar since he first filled in when Ripa’s last Live co-host, Michael Strahan, was on the air. “His time has just come. He did his bit when he came in to replace Michael Strahan and has done a fine job for six years. And ABC has always appreciated that,” the insider said. “But Ryan has quite the ego and he doesn’t like the fact that Mark has proven to be so popular when he fills in for him.”</p><p>Though they consider themselves “family” now, Seacrest and Ripa were also at the center of rumors when he joined Live With Kelly in 2017. A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> at the time that, when Seacrest joined Live With Kelly, Ripa was worried he would prioritize his job as the host of American Idol over their show. “She doesn’t want a repeat of the Michael Strahan situation. It’s like ABC is once again diluting the attention on Live,” the insider said, referring to Ripa’s former Live co-host, Michael Strahan. “She wants to make sure her show is Ryan’s first priority, not Idol.”</p><p>The source also claimed that that Seacrest’s return to American Idol (which was rebooted by ABC after it was cancelled by FOX) and his role on Live With Kelly and Ryan were a packaged deal.&nbsp;“This isn’t some spur-of-the-moment deal. It’s a part of his move to ABC,” the insider said. “It’s a no-brainer. He took the job for Idol and to host Live. It’s the only way ABC could pay him enough money to come over. They’ll have to announce it before upfronts.”</p><p>A representative for Seacrest denied the claim.&nbsp;“That’s untrue. He does not have a deal with Idol,” the representative said. “He’s in conversations. His Live deal was made independent of any Idol discussions. His priority is Live With Kelly and Ryan and his radio show.”</p><p>Another source also told Page Six at the time that Ripa was “100 percent on board” with Seacrest returning to American Idol.&nbsp;“Kelly is in the loop. She had approval over the co-host, so Ryan was her first choice. It was a very calculated decision by the network and by her. Everyone is thrilled. They’ve known each other 15 years,” the source said. “They really are friends.” The insider continued,&nbsp;“He’s not going to do anything to jeopardize Live. He has a long-term commitment to the show. He’s excited to be living in New York, and this is a big deal for him.” A representative for Ripa denied the claim that she was in a “loop” over Seacrest’s return to American Idol. “It’s all false. She’s been fully in the loop,” the representative said. A spokesperson for ABC also denied Page Six‘s report at the time. “Everything is categorically not true.”</p><p>A representative for Live With Kelly and Ryan also denied Page Six‘s claim that Ripa and Seacrest were “off to a rocky start.” “They’re thrilled to be working together, and it shows,” the representative told<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> E! News</a> at the time. “Their chemistry is palpable.” A source close to the show also told E! News that there was “no truth” to Page Six‘s report of “friction” between Ripa and Seacrest at the time. “They get along famously. They truly love each other and speak several times a day. They respect each one another. She supports his other commitments and he supports hers. Ryan and Kelly have the same work ethic and values,” the insider said. “That’s why it works so well.”</p><p>The source continued, “They are having a good time. People want to create drama but there really is none. Kelly is the happiest she has been in a while. She has a partner now, and it’s taken a lot of pressure off of her.” The insider also claimed that Ripa and Seacrest had talked about him returning to American Idol so there were “no surprises.” “Kelly and Ryan have open and transparent conversations. There will be no surprises,” the source said. “They are partners.” The source continued, “She is having the best time with Ryan and truly feels she has a partner in her co-host. Should Idol happen, she feels Ryan Seacrest is the heart and soul of American Idol and therefore she’s 100 percent on board.”</p><p>A source also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> in October 2017 that asked him to cancel an appearance on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Good Morning America</a> to promote American Idol at time due to her past relationship with Michael Strahan, who left Live With Kelly to join GMA. “Ryan was scheduled to be on Wednesday’s show well in advance. He’s been on the show rundown for a week. Then yesterday, or maybe even as late as last night, Kelly threw a shit fit and told him he couldn’t do GMA, so he pulled his appearance,” the insider said. “It’s very clear that Ryan wants to stay on her good side. She’s an executive producer on the show, so she has a lot of pull. It’s fair to say she has a lot of influence over him. He joined her show. It sounds like she still feels threatened. There’s still bad blood with Kelly and Strahan, and she doesn’t want history to repeat itself and Ryan to be lured to GMA too.”</p><p>The source continued, “Kelly isn’t going to be reprimanded for this, as diva-like as it is, because it’s not worth upsetting her for a three-minute hit with Ryan on GMA. They had the three judges, and the big star Katy Perry, anyway.” A representative for Seacrest denied Page Six‘s report at the time.&nbsp;“Ryan had wanted to appear on GMA with the new Idol judges … but with the constant shifting of various schedules, we determined yesterday, along with GMA, as well as ABC/Freemantle producers and publicity teams, that his schedule was too tight given his morning commitments with Live and his radio show, along with Idol production commitments,” the representative said. “To suggest any other reason for him not participating is completely false or a misunderstanding of the facts.” A representative for Ripa also denied the report. “This story is absolutely not true,” the representative said.</p><h2>Who is replacing Ryan Seacrest on Live With Kelly?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Mark-Consuelos-Kelly-Ripa-1.jpg><p>Who is replacing replacing Ryan Seacrest on Live With Kelly?
