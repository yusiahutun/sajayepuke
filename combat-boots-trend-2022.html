Members from SEVENTEEN, BTS, Blackpink, EXO, NCT, BIGBANG, and more charmed designers, trended on Twitter, and nabbed those coveted front-row seats across multiple time zones.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This year’s Fashion Weeks have made one thing clear: Luxury fashion houses are entering their K-pop era.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The link between luxury fashion and K-pop is unmistakable. Both are in the aesthetic business, using visual arts to tell stories and create brand mythos. Fashion and K-pop are industries where extravagance, opulence, and beauty for the sake of beauty are embraced. The idols themselves are the perfect partners for fashion houses: their boundary-pushing aesthetics mean they’re willing risk-takers, making them appealing collaborators for luxury brands always trying to spark the next major trend or capture the next viral moment.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">K-pop is now an international habit, not just a Korean trend. Worldwide fans are emulating their favorite members, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>including creating buying frenzies that sell out items worn by idols in the hours or sometimes minutes after the images appear on social media</a>. “There are not that many people in the world who can impact a brand that much,” Ukrainian milliner Ruslan Baginskiy tells InStyle after BTS's Kim Taehyung wore one of his hats and instantly depleted the global stock of the piece. Brands who aspire to develop and deepen their own worldwide fan clubs are smart to partner with idols who have already done just that (as demonstrated by ENHYPEN’s Italian fans causing an unexpectedly passionate furor at Milan Fashion Week).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And the love goes both ways. Inspiration ricochets back and forth between K-pop artists and designers. Labels are name-dropped in verses and designers create tour costumes for idols. The shared synergy has built a bridge between the fashion and K-pop worlds, leading to a recent unprecedented surge in idols being tapped as brand ambassadors.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Kings of 2023’s Fashion Week: SEVENTEEN</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">No K-pop group made a bigger impact on Fashion Week this year than SEVENTEEN. The full-time idols, part-time social butterflies nabbed those all-important front-row seats at four different fashion houses’ runways.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Since it was my first Fashion Week experience ever, the trip itself will be a memory I will cherish forever,” Hoshi, who attended AMI’s runway presentation, tells InStyle. “I’m very much interested in fashion, so it was an honor to be invited and I had so much fun.” Not only was it the global superstar’s first Fashion Week, it was also his first time in the City of Light making the experience extra darling. “It was also my first time in Paris, and I felt that Fashion Week added to the allure of the city itself. Visuals play a key part in what I do, I hope that I will also be able to translate this experience into music and performances that we present.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hoshi isn’t alone in taking away a souvenir of inspiration from his Fashion Week visit. Fellow SEVENTEEN member Joshua attended Marni's special Tokyo presentation, also receiving a dose of artistic motivation for his efforts. “I think it will definitely inspire my work,” the singer tells InStyle, after surveying the saturated color palette and bespoke tailoring of Marni’s runway presentation. “I felt like the overall production and style spoke to me. The music started changing with the color of the clothing, from the mood starting a little bright to the mood getting darker. It was evident that a lot of thought and so many intricate details were put into this whole production.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The experience of attending Fashion Week was particularly impactful for Mingyu, who sat alongside Joshua at Marni’s front row. “Fashion is always a source of inspiration for me,” explained Mingyu, who solidified his “fashion icon” status years ago after walking as a model in Seoul’s Fashion Week. “Being able to immerse myself in fashion through fashion shows, in particular, is even more intuitive of an inspiration. The stage production, the music, the colors and all the looks were a new drive and thrill to me. If opportunities arise down the road, I would love to continue on with these experiences.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile in Paris, Jeonghan fell in love with every sublime and sexy look that walked down the Saint Laurent runway.

Creative Director Pierpaolo Piccioli cited the rapper and producer<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2> as a source of inspiration explaining</a>, “[He’s] a multifaceted artist; he is an interpreter and uses his talent and his work to express himself with energy and authenticity.

To make the wait more fun, ARMY has been batting around couture house names on Twitter and in group chats like kittens batting around toy mice. Fans are hoping Kim Namjoon, stage name RM, blesses Bottega Veneta with his broad shoulders. The BTS leader <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wore several Bottega Veneta looks while promoting his solo album, Indigo</a>, and the brand itself recently added a dose of validity to the rumored partnership thanks to some recent, high-profile Instagram follows: Matthieu Blazy, Bottega Veneta’s creative director and Dario Gargiulo, the chief marketing and digital business officer, both followed the rapper recently. And with RM sitting front row at Bottega Veneta’s Milan presentation this weekend, an official brand ambassadorship announcement seems all but inevitable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Currently serving in the South Korean military isn’t stopping rumors of eldest member Kim Seokjin signing with Cartier when he returns to civilian life.

Including the architecture, I was immediately taken aback by how aesthetically pleasing the entire city is.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ni-Ki, the youngest member of the group, echoed that awe-inspired sentiment. “I just felt like I was inside a movie,” he tells InStyle. “I really enjoyed the sense of peace in Milan. The architecture was incredible.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The K-Pop rookies who debuted in 2020 are used to causing a commotion whenever they go, but their fans (nicknamed ENGENE, a play on “engine” since they fuel ENHYPEN’s passionate performances), surprised everyone when they turned up by the thousands in Italy just to catch a glimpse of their favorite artists before Prada’s show. “I, like the other members, was so surprised by the number of ENGENEs who came out to see us,” Sunoo tells InStyle. “We haven’t had the opportunity to meet many international ENGENEs in person yet and just starting to do so through our tour, so I felt so supported seeing the crowd at the show. We promise to work even harder to deliver positive energy to our ENGENEs moving forward.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The invitation from Prada and meeting the legendary designers Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons was a particular honor for Jay, who has often cited the fashion world as a major source of his creative passion. “They are two individuals in the fashion industry whom I have always admired, so meeting them in the flesh was a true honor,” Jay tells InStyle. Indeed, The Idol became The Fan when meeting the two icons. “Interacting and taking pictures with them is an unforgettable memory that will stick with me for a while.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It was such an honor to meet [Miuccia and Raf] in person,” Jake agreed. “I was thrilled to attend the show and would love to be invited again in the future,” the idol said (getting our hopes up for more future perfect partnerships with Prada).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Much like SEVENTEEN's Hoshi, Mingyu, and Joshua, the members of ENHYPEN soaked up as much inspiration as they could on their whirlwind visit to Prada. “Just being in Milan itself for Fashion Week was fantastic,” Jungwon tells InStyle. The leader of ENHYPEN found his muse in every moment, every detail of his trip — down to the very streets he walked on. “I was impressed by how stylish and well-dressed the people there were. I could also take photos on the cobblestone streets and they would turn out just like the ones taken for our official photoshoots.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As ENHYPEN returned to South Korea with Fashion Week in their rearview, inspiration stoked in their hearts, and a renewed love of their devoted fans, it's clear that they had been a part of one of the buzziest runway seasons yet. There's one unmistakeable conclusion to draw: Fashion Week may be over, but fashion’s K-pop crush is just getting started.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-j-hope-of-bts-at-hermss-fallwinter-mens-collection-in-paris></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>j-hope of BTS at Hermès’s Fall/Winter Men’s Collection in Paris</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The "Jack in the Box" singer and dance leader of BTS brought his signature sunshine to Paris Fashion Week when he attended Hermès’s fall menswear collection wearing a covetable shearling jacket straight from the runway.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-j-hope-of-bts-at-louis-vuittons-fallwinter-mens-collection-in-paris></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>j-hope of BTS at Louis Vuitton’s Fall/Winter Men’s Collection in Paris</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Having served as a global ambassador for Louis Vuitton (alongside his BTS bandmates) in 2021</a>, Jung Hoseok blessed the brand with his presence for its Paris Fashion Week presentation.
