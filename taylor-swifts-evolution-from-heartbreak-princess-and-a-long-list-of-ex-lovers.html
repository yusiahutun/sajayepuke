It has been 19 years since she signed her first record deal. After signing her name on the dotted line, there’s been no stopping her. Whether you know Taylor Swift’s lyrics off by heart, or stumbled upon the singer by chance – she’ll have an everlasting effect on you.</strong></p><p>So who is <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>? Well, she’s the cultural phenomenon of the 21st century whose plethora of breakup anthems speaks volumes to generations. The ‘anti-hero’ who has remade herself despite media trials and broke all records to prove she encompasses the ‘<a href=#>music</a> industry’. She’s also the artist who manages to dig three layers deep into her vulnerability and accept her illicit affairs with every new album. Or perhaps she’s simply the 33-year-old <a href=#>celebrity</a> who can perform 44 songs night after night for sold-out stadiums, and enchant millions of fans leaving them with no Blank Space but a lifetime of treasure-trove memories. It’s hard to describe Taylor in one word, let alone a feature, but we’ll try.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-beginning-of-taylor-swift>The beginning of Taylor Swift</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1474266803-1024x683.jpg><p>Taylor Swift mania can probably be boiled down to four things, lyrics, ex-boyfriends, her movie and re-recording her albums.</p><p>Taylor’s big break came at the age of 14 when she signed with Big Machine Records. She went on to release six albums under the label including her self-titled debut album, Taylor Swift ,which debuted at number five on the US Billboard 200.</p><p>The album went on to make history as it stayed in the Billboard 200 for 157 weeks, making it the longest by any release in the US during the 2000s.</p><p>The Our Song crooner also became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a US platinum-certified debut album.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-is-fearless>She is Fearless</h3><p>Taylor Swift’s Fearless took the music charts by storm. It was her first number-one album on the Billboard 200 and quickly cemented itself as 2009’s top-selling album in the US.</p><p>The track You Belong with Me was the album’s highest-charting single on the Hot 100 as well. It peaked at number two and became the first country song to top Billboard’s all-genre Radio Songs chart.</p><p>And I don’t know how it gets better than this.</p><p>But it did.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-speak-now-to-reputation-the-formation-era>Speak Now to Reputation, the formation era</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1604851365-1024x689.jpg><p>After Fearless, Taylor Swift’s lyrics finally became noticed outside her loyal following. Finally, people were listening.</p><p>Her next venture, Speak Now, sold one million copies and graced the Top 200. The 20-something-old country singer’s mature approach in the album made critics pour praise.</p><p>Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote: “In a mere four years, the 20-year-old Nashville firecracker has put her name on three dozen or so of the smartest songs released by anyone in pop, rock or country.”</p><p>Fearless and Speak Now were only the beginning, as the widespread craze only continued to grow with her next albums like Red, with 1.21 million sales.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-big-reputation>Big Reputation</h3><p>Looking back, Taylor Swift’s Reputation was THE moment that foretold, just like in her lyrics, why so many fade but she will stay. The singer took a hiatus from social media for a year and came back with Reputation in 2017. While haters predicted the Swift era ended and the upcoming album wouldn’t leave a mark on the charts.</p><p>But the Bad Blood hitmaker proved her influence wasn’t going anywhere. It debuted atop the Top 200 with 1.21 million sales, making Tay Tay the first act to have four albums sell one million copies in a week.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lover-to-midnights>Lover to Midnights</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1637208780-1024x683.jpg><p>Taylor’s new era of owning her own music came with her seventh studio album Lover. After she left Big Machine Records she signed with Universal Music Group. Her subsequent albums and re-records of old albums including, Red Taylor’s Version (TV), Fearless (TV) and Speak Now (TV), have maintained their good ol’ number one spot. They were the only re-records in history to ever achieve this feat.</p><p>Taylor Swift dropped Midnights in 2022 and proved that she can still make the whole place shimmer. It appears striving to make history is now a yearly ritual for Tay Tay. Her tenth studio album Midnights was dubbed as an ‘instant classic’ and went on to break all records. 10 songs from the record monopolized the entire top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart at the time. Needless to say, she became the first artist in history to make the Top 10 look like her tracklist.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-s-lyrics-makes-all-of-us-feel-things>Taylor Swift’s lyrics makes ‘all of us’ feel things</h2><p>From academia to TV shows, Taylor Swift has been acknowledged as a genius lyric master and songwriter who just knows how to resonate with fans.</p><p>Some examples include:</p><p>Hi, It’s Me, I Am The Problem, It’s Me (Anti Hero, Midnights) or Don’t treat me like some situation that needs to be handled / I’m fine with my spite and my tears, and my beers and my candles, (Closure, from Evermore).</p><p>Taylor Swift can utter a thing or two about life seamlessly never shying away from being vulnerable and even sharing ‘shame’ of her own past with millions.</p><p>Speaking of her lyrics that delve deeper into her life, Taylor Swift was once candid in an interview.</p><p>She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gushed</a>: “I don’t think that art and suffering have to be holding hands. I think you can write songs about pain or grief … suffering … loss … hard things that you go through in life. Shame, you know, love to write about that one.”</p><p>But Tay Tay is not just about sharing her feelings, sometimes (well, too many times), she also makes music to clapback personal vendettas or simply stand up for herself. Not afraid of looking at the tabloid headlines crucifying her in the eye.</p><p>“Sometimes the lines in a song are lines you wish you could text-message somebody in real life,” Swift said in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one interview.</a> “I would just be constantly writing all these zingers — like, ‘Burn. That would really get her.'”</p><p>After all, she sings in Karma, Cause if you dare, you’ll see the glare/ Of everyone you burned just to get there/ It’s coming back around.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-got-a-long-list-of-ex-lovers-taylor-swift-s-boyfriends>Got a long list of ex-lovers – Taylor Swift’s boyfriends</h2><p>Taylor’s songs which talk a lot about her ex-lovers have been the center of media attention for two decades.

The breakup caught attention as Tay shared how Joe broke up with her in a 25-second phone call!</p><p>But there is no major Bad Blood there. However, fans claim Taylor Swift’s lyrics in Mr. Perfectly Fine is actually about the Sucker crooner.
