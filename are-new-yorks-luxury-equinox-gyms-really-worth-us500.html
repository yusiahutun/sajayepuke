There were also multiple large spaces for hanging out or working.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The yoga room had a conspicuous lack of windows, which felt a bit claustrophobic and detracted from the vibe I prefer.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">The Avengers workout series: tackle the Iron Man challenge</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Compared with other locations catering to the Midtown crowd, though, the Gramercy location came off as pretty nice if you're looking for a convenient, pleasant location.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On its own, I wouldn't say a membership to this gym would be worth nearly US$200 per month, but taken together with other gyms, this location could be a good fit if you work in the area.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gramercy gets a 5/10 for a fairly average experience that was on brand, but with minimal crowding.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Greenwich Avenue: feels like an old YMCA, for better or for worse</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/06/03/3c3f88fc-8372-11e9-bda2-8286175bc410_972x_180429.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Equinox's West Village location feels like a time machine that takes you back to how neighbourhood might have felt before it became a hub for the rich and famous.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Opening in 2001, the large complex includes ample natural light and a basement pool, but feels more like a community centre than a pleasure palace.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Part of that is because of the decor, which clearly has not been updated with the rest of the brand's aesthetic.

Throughout my experience, E was off limits in terms of photos because of privacy concerns for their members, according to the company.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet the training space at Columbus Circle was wholly viewable from the pool open to all Equinox members.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">10 Hong Kong wellness and self-care events in March</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The fitness area is simply a square floor with weights, resistance bands, some cardio equipment and not much else. Where E Madison's sparseness felt elevated, the Columbus Circle location simply felt empty.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Compared with E Madison's luxurious changing room, the “changing cabanas” came off more as private bathrooms – only one shower head included. The products found were Fresh brand when I visited, but the manager told me they would be changed to match the line in E Madison.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite a private bathroom for each visitor, having only one staff member meant that the cleanliness fell below E Madison's standard. The one I was shown had hair in the sink, and some scraps of paper on the floor.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">More glaring was the fact that there were no private saunas or steam rooms for E members. If an E enrollee wanted a steam, they'd have to walk a few yards to the plebeian shower room open to all Equinox Columbus Circle members.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The manager who showed me the space wasn't blind to the disparity between E Madison and Columbus Circle. He openly complained about how Equinox's efforts to build up the E brand left his space in a rut.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The training space is exclusively for training and is by appointment only.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He says that now members who joined through E Madison are showing up expecting to be able to access the training space without an appointment. Since there are no changing rooms, only cabanas, this presents a logistical problem.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While I actually believe in the value of training provided for E members, the Columbus Circle training space has fallen behind in Equinox's quest to set the E brand apart in privacy and luxury.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Equinox says the space is set for renovation in the next few months to be more in line with updates to the E brand.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">E Columbus Circle gets a 5/10 for a slightly elevated experience at an unrealistic price.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The price of Equinox's top membership seems like a steep climb for marginal differences in training quality and luxury and is probably only worth it for the uber-wealthy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">E by Equinox certainly offers one of the highest levels of luxury and training available in the consumer gym market, but the leap to spending over US$20,000 is a big one that's essentially only available to the uber-wealthy.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">7 great women-only wellness retreats to visit</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For the average person, this expense wouldn't be worth it for the marginal amount of luxury and training quality that you receive.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet for clients who have the ability to spend that much on their gym membership, it's probably normal to spend a lot of cash for a product that's just slightly better.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Want more stories like this?
