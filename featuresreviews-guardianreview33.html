I also knew that she had become Mrs Blanco White, a figure who was pointed out to me on various occasions in my Hampstead days when she lived on Downshire Hill. I had paid little attention to Mrs Blanco White, who paid even less attention to me. She died in 1981, so it is too late now to speak to her, even if she would have agreed to speak to me.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Last year, the colourful name of Amber Reeves Blanco White became one of many welcome additions to the new Dictionary of National Biography. Amber's mother, Maud Pember Reeves, Fabian author of the classic sociological survey of poverty in Lambeth, Round About a Pound a Week (1913), also appears there for the first time. Thirty years of feminist scholarship and women's studies have made their mark.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Some of the facts now established in Sally Alexander's excellent DNB entry were already available. It was well known that Amber Reeves had been educated at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she read Moral Sciences and gained a double first in 1908, and that she had been a founding member of the Cambridge Fabian Society. Her liaison with Wells and her hurried marriage of convenience to the lawyer Rivers Blanco White were notorious, and had been described by various biographers, most notably Wells's son by Rebecca West, Anthony West. But her subsequent career was less often discussed. It was less well known that she taught adult education classes at Morley College in south London, where I also taught for some years: by coincidence, or by posthumous telepathic sympathy, one of the novels we studied there, in a course on women in fiction in the early 1970s, was Ann Veronica itself.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>At the time I had no notion of this Morley College connection, nor, until this year, had I read any of her books. Conventional wisdom held that she retired into private life after her affair with Wells and the birth of their child, Anna-Jane, but this was not the case. She remained active in politics, worked during the first world war in the Admiralty and the ministry of munitions, and published several books: her novels were published under the name of Amber Reeves, her other works under her married name. She maintained a friendship with Wells, who asked her to contribute to The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind (1932). She also had two more children, Margaret Justin and Thomas, born in 1912 and 1914.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The DNB reveals many details that were not previously accessible. This was an interesting life, and one that well deserved to be recovered. Amber, like Ann Veronica, was a forceful, strong-minded, highly intelligent, and very attractive young woman, with a fine disregard for propriety. Alexander cites Wells's description of her as "a girl of brilliant and precocious promise ... [with] a sharp, bright, Levantine face under a shock of very fine abundant black hair, a slender nimble body very much alive, and a quick greedy mind". Her physical presence colours the description of young Isabel Rivers in The New Machiavelli (1911), where she bounds disruptively into the plot as an energetic tomboy with a warm brown skin, wearing "a shapeless thing like a blue smock that made her quick bright-changing face seem yellow under her cloud of black hair".</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The scandal of her affair with Wells provided much enjoyable gossip and outrage, for Amber was immediately identifiable as the model for Ann Veronica, as West described: "She was all too clearly drawn from life. She used turns of phrase familiar to everyone who knew Amber Reeves, spoke in her voice, and behaved as she behaved ..." As a result of the affair, Wells was ostracised by some of his friends, and resigned from the Savile Club, to which he had been introduced by her father, the New Zealand-born politician William Pember Reeves.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Much of this was recorded with prurient relish in the diaries of fellow Fabian Beatrice Webb, who was particularly outraged by the notion that Amber had been seduced "within the very walls of Newnham, [Wells] having been permitted, as an old friend, to go to her room". This is possibly not how Amber Reeves saw it. She seems to have taken an active part in the relationship, and her sexually assertive behaviour links her more to the concept of the "New Woman" and to the "Life Force" proposed by Bernard Shaw than to the stereotype of the betrayed maiden. In 1909 she had spoken on women's suffrage in the debating society at Morley College, and a few weeks later on the question of free will, initiating, according to the club's secretary, "the best discussion we ever had". She was more combative than passive in her approach to the world. One of her close friends, who provided her with a hideaway during her pregnancy, was the celebrated feminist actress and writer Elizabeth Robins, author of the influential play Votes for Women! (1907), which shows much sympathy with the plight of the unmarried mother.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The life of Amber Reeves did not come to a standstill when she was 21. She did not dwindle away into silent and inactive respect-ability: Wells, in his later novel Marriage (1912), projected a fictional future in which the daring runaway of the earlier novel appears as a "dark-haired quiet-mannered wife ... a woman of impulsive speech and long silences, who had subsided from an early romance ... into a markedly correct and exclusive mother of daughters". This summary does not do her justice. Correct in manner Mrs Blanco White may have been, and some of those who remember her recollect a formidable figure, but she was also a hard-working writer and a lecturer with a keen interest in new ideas in feminism, but also anthropology, monetary theory and psychology.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Her publications illustrate the range of her concerns. She published four novels, and four other works on subjects as varied as the nationalisation of banking, propaganda, popular psychology and ethics. Her first novel, The Reward of Virtue (1911), is about the inadequacies of conventional female education, and dwells particularly effectively on its naive heroine's ignorance about money, and her habit, when she found herself not very happily married, of going shopping and running up large bills because she had nothing better to do - a sequence which foreshadows a similar theme of ignorant female extravagance in Wells's Marriage . This reminds us that Amber's mother Maud and father William were said to have quarrelled much about money: Maud had been shocked to discover that upon marriage her husband had expected to take charge of her finances, and, when she inherited money later in life, she avoided handing her bequests over to him. Women, she warned, should not be financially dependent upon men. The daughter inherited the mother's social concerns.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Money provides the dominant theme of Reeves's second and best novel, A Lady and Her Husband (1914), written when she had three small children to care for. This work deals even more trenchantly with domestic finance, patriarchal authority, and with the nature of capitalism itself. This too is a form of a Bildungsroman , in which the heroine discovers her own inadequacies and learns from them, but here the protagonist is a good-hearted 46-year-old middle-class married woman, Mary Heyham, who finds herself at a loose end when her three children grow up and leave the nest. Under pressure from her youngest, free-thinking socialist daughter, she decides to educate herself about the nature of her husband's thriving catering business: she examines the hard lives of his waitress-employees (just as Amber's mother scrutinised the lives and finances of the mothers of Lambeth) and decides to take up their cause. When her husband plans to turn his business into a public company, she realises that he cannot do this without her consent, as a major shareholder, for he has invested heavily in her name. She works out that the employees will fare even worse at the hands of a public company, run for the benefit of dividends and shareholders, and stubbornly refuses, to his wrath, to sign away her rights.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The most curious and interesting section of this novel comes towards the end, when Mary leaves home secretly in order to think things through. With a sense that "her intellectual life was only beginning" (we remember that Morley was, and is, a college of adult education) she takes a small flat in Chelsea, where, for a week, she battles with such works as "The Shareholder's Guide to Company Law". And she is very happy in her flat, where nobody can find her. Far from being frightened by the unaccustomed solitude, she rejoices in it. The flat is decorated in bright, bohemian colours, which glow in the text: a Japanese orange and red sofa, a bedroom of Chinese blue, sea-green and indigo. She is happy in her freedom, and in "the gay reassurance of the beautiful room".</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The ending is more conventional: she does not concede, for she has discovered that her financial and legal position is impregnable, but she goes back to her husband when he agrees that he would be better advised to change tack and go in for philanthropy and politics. On her return to her large London town house, she reflects that "The entrance hall was more like a dream ... in its tall ugliness, than the queer red and orange room that they had left to the windy night." She settles back into her life of ease and servants, but with a new confidence, a new sense of expectation and engagement. The ending is optimistic, as she looks out at the night world from her window.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Reeves's other novels, Helen in Love (1916) and Give and Take: A Novel of Intrigue (1923), are less successful, but the dissident spirit of A Lady and Her Husband continues to glow like a prophetic beacon. It is a very early treatment of the theme of a woman's need for a room of her own. Mary Heyham's pleasure in her runaway solitude (and her husband's desire to keep the truth of her disappearance from the servants) finds a haunting real-life echo in a memorial of Mrs Yates Thompson, the utterly respectable, enormously wealthy, shy and philanthropic daughter of George Smith, publisher of Charlotte Brontë and of the original DNB . Thompson was one day seized by "a desire to taste this wild fruit, 'liberty'", and when her husband was away for a few days, she evaded the butler, made off with her toothbrush and nightgown, and "took a train and went somewhere utterly unknown to her, put up at a modest hotel, and came home the next day. The butler as he let her in betrayed no sign." She remembered her escapade with pleasure, indicating the hotel to a companion a few months before her death in 1941 with the words "This place is where I stayed a night once. And no one ever knew."</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>This anecdote is told by Reeves's friend and defender Elizabeth Robins in a sketch, Portrait of a Lady (1941), first published by the Hogarth Press and reprinted at Newnham College, Cambridge, in 2002. Newnham's first library, built in 1897 and extended in 1907, was endowed by Mr and Mrs Yates Thompson. Reeves studied there, and Virginia Woolf, when she visited Cambridge to speak about "Women and Fiction" in 1928, was no doubt shown around it. These are connections Woolf would have recognised. My mother studied in Newnham library, and I in turn studied there. I too recognise connections.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Forty years later, Doris Lessing, at the beginning of the new wave of postwar women's writing, addressed the subject of the secret room. In one of her darkest and most influential stories, "To Room Nineteen", Lessing analyses the modern marriage of two tolerant, intelligent, middle-class professionals. The wife, Susan, gives up her job to bring up her four children, finds domestic life and marriage increasingly meaningless, and begins to rent a room in a seedy hotel in Paddington. She sits there, day by day, in a wicker chair, doing nothing, in a "dark creative trance". Her husband, reasonably suspecting that she has a lover, discovers her retreat, and is more than willing to condone her supposed infidelity. Her response is to lock herself into her room, put two shillings in the gas meter, turn on the gas, and drift off into the dark river. This story was published in a collection called A Man and Two Women in 1963 - the year when Sylvia Plath committed suicide.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Woolf had drowned herself in 1941. In the same year, Amber Reeves Blanco White published with Gollancz a work of common-sense psychology with the brilliantly memorable title Worry in Women . Addressed to a wartime generation, it tackled subjects related to the stress of war - fear of bombing, marital tension, infidelity, aggression, hostility towards and from one's children. She quotes from Freud, Ernest Jones and Melanie Klein, and in her last full-length book, Ethics for Unbelievers (1949), she explores the origins of childhood conscience in recognisably Freudian terms.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Amber Blanco White died on December 26 1981, aged 94. Her long life was part of a continuing story, and she left a rich and eccentric legacy. She is survived by varied grandchildren, and she herself survives as a writer, and also as the brave, spirited, youthful Ann Veronica. Wells called her "Dusa", a shortened form of his pet name "Medusa", and this name for her also survives in the family. She was a Medusa and a Muse, and she managed to avoid an appointment with death in Room Nineteen. A woman's room, she one wrote, was "her adventure, her defence, her stronghold". Reeves made good use of it, and helped to strengthen women's claims to space in real life and in the pages of the DNB.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>© Margaret Drabble</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>· </strong>Ann Veronica by HG Wells, is published by Penguin <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>Classics</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaJqfpLi0e5FpZ25nkaW%2FcHyRaJ2emaSqv6a%2F0Z6top2nqHuowcCrm6KZnqeyt7XEsGps</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2ffeaturesreviews-guardianreview33.html&title=A%20room%20of%20her%20own%20%7c%20Books" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffeaturesreviews-guardianreview33.html&description=A%20room%20of%20her%20own%20%7c%20Books" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffeaturesreviews-guardianreview33.html&title=A%20room%20of%20her%20own%20%7c%20Books" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2ffeaturesreviews-guardianreview33.html&title=A%20room%20of%20her%20own%20%7c%20Books" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2ffeaturesreviews-guardianreview33.html&text=A%20room%20of%20her%20own%20%7c%20Books" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2ffeaturesreviews-guardianreview33.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Jenniffer Sheldon</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-09-11</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./bennet-omalu-married-to-prema-mutiso-the-couple-happily-living-in-lodi-california-with-two-children.html><h3>&lt;&lt; American Forensic Pathologist Bennet Omalu Married to Prema Mutiso; How Did He Proposed His Wife?
