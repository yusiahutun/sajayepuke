We’ll explain that later, but let’s just say that one of their net worths is way more than the other.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Bündchen</a>—who is one of five sisters—was <a href=# rel=noopener>discovered by Elite Model Management</a> at a shopping mall in São Paulo, Brazil in 1994. At the time, Bündchen, who grew up in Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil, wanted to be a volleyball player but took a modeling class with her sisters Patricia and Gabriela in hopes that it would correct her posture. After she was scouted by Elite, Bündchen was selected as a contestant for a national contest with the agency known as Look of the Year. She placed second in the competition and moved to São Paulo at the age of 14 to start her modeling career. In 1996, Bündchen walked in her first show in New York Fashion Show, and the success continued from there.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/84489_12609168951.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/84237_12608047291.jpg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$13.46</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$30.00</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>55% Off</span></p><p>In the next few years, <a href=# rel=noopener>Bündchen went on to model</a> for designers like Alexander McQueen, Missoni, Chloé, Dolce & Gabbana, Valentino, Ralph Lauren and Versace. She also covered fashion magazines like Vogue Paris and British Vogue. In 1999, Bündchen left Elite and signed a new contract with IMG Models. That same year, Bündchen posed for her first American Vogue cover alongside supermodels like Kate Moss, Christy Turlington, <a href=# rel=noopener>Naomi Campbell</a> and Claudia Schiffer. In 2000, Bündchen made her debut as a Victoria’s Secret Angel. She worked with the brand until her retirement as an angel in 2007.</p><p>In her 20-plus years in the fashion industry, Bündchen also worked with brands like Chanel No. 5 and Pantene, and starred in films like 2006’s The Devil Wears Prada. With all of her success, fans around the world want to know how much is <a href=# rel=noopener>Gisele Bündchen’s net worth</a> and what was her divorce settlement <a href=# rel=noopener>Tom Brady</a>.

She worked with the brand for almost a decade until her retirement and final runaway show as an angel in 2007. According to Forbes, the model signed a five-year contract with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Victoria’s Secret</a> in 2000 for $25 million.&nbsp;At her first fashion show with the brand in 2000, Bündchen wore Victoria’s Secret’s $15 million Fantasy Bra, which is listed in the Guinness World Records as one of the most expensive pieces of lingerie ever made. Bündchen wore the Fantasy Bra again in 2005. The bra was worth $12.5 million, which is the second most expensive bra the brand has made.</p><h2>What is Gisele Bündchen’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Gisele-Bundchen-2.jpg><p>The question everyone wants to know: What is Gisele Bündchen’s net worth? Well, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Gisele Bündchen’s net worth is $400 million, which is almost double what her husband Tom Brady is worth. She makes $40 million per year, according to Celebrity Net Worth. (The site reports that Brady is worth <a href=# rel=noopener>$250 million</a> and has an annual $30 million salary.) Fans shouldn’t be too surprised by Bündchen’s net worth as she was named by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a> as the highest paid model in the world for the 14th year in a row in 2016, beating models like Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid at the time. Of course, Bündchen’s net worth comes from multi-million-dollar contracts with brands like Pantene, Chanel, Victoria’s Secret and Carolina Herrera, as well as partnerships with companies like Arezzo shoes and SkyTV in her native Brazil.</p><p>In 2011, the model launched her own eco-friendly skin care line, <a data-pmc-sp-product=d27d722f599dec7820814340ecf9df6c href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Sejaa Pure Skincare","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Sejaa Spa-Therapy Facial Kit Stress Relief, All Natural Skin Care Kit By Gisele- Sejaa Pure Skincare Kit By Gisele Bundchen, Limited Edition 3-Pack Kit With Free Towel","id":"B009WXG0PU","category":"Washcloths & Towels"},"id":1190457,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Sejaa Pure Skincare</a> , which also added to her net worth, according to Forbes. Seven years later, in 2018, Bündchen published her first memoir, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life</a>, which became an instant New York Times Bestseller. Needless to say, all of these projects add to Bündchen’s net worth.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Elle</a> in 2022, Gisele opened up about how she took a break from her modeling career to support Tom and their children. “I’ve done my part, which is [to] be there for [Brady]. I moved to Boston, and I focused on creating a cocoon and a loving environment for my children to grow up in and to be there supporting him and his dreams,” she said. “Seeing my children succeed and become the beautiful little humans that they are, seeing [Brady] succeed, and being fulfilled in his career—it makes me happy. At this point in my life, I feel like I’ve done a good job on that.” Gisele also told Elle at the time that, now that her children are older, she plans to get back to her career.&nbsp; “I have a huge list of things that I have to do, that I want to do. At 42, I feel more connected with my purpose,” she said.</p><p>Still, Gisele didn’t regret the time she spent with her children and explained she was “so grateful” to have been a part of “really shaping who [her kids] are as people.” “I feel very fulfilled in that way, as a mother and as a wife,” she said. “And now it’s going to be my turn. It’s not like I’m going to be in the valley forever.” Gisele also told Elle that she wished Tom was “more present” in her children’s lives. “Obviously, I have my concerns—this is a very violent sport, and I have my children and I would like him to be more present,” she said of her then-husband. “I have definitely had those conversations with him over and over again. But ultimately, I feel that everybody has to make a decision that works for [them]. He needs to follow his joy, too.”</p><p>In Tom’s 2021 documentary Man in the Arena, Gisele also explained that she chose to take a “back seat” in her career so that Tom could focus on his. “I want him to be very fulfilled. I felt like very fulfilled in my career, so I felt like I was okay to kind of take the back seat, and I wanted him to have all the room that he needed to perform at his best because I knew that he wasn’t going to be happy if he didn’t,” she said. Tom, for his part, told producers of the documentary, which aired a year before his and Gisele’s divorce, about how he and his then-wife were able to overcome so many “ups and downs.” “We found each other at the right time. We’ve been through a lot of ups and downs together, and in so many ways, that’s kind of built our relationship so strong,” he said.</p><h2>What was Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady’s divorce settlement?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Tom-Brady-Gisele-Bundchen.jpg><p>What was Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady’s divorce settlement? <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> reported in October 2022 that Brady and Bündchen had hired divorce lawyers after their separation following a fight over Brady’s unretirement from the NFL and his decision to return to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers three months after announcing he was done with football.&nbsp;“I never actually thought this argument would be the end of them, but it looks like it is,” a source told Page Six at the time. “I don’t think there will be any coming back now. They both have lawyers and are looking at what a split will entail, who gets what and what the finances will be.”</p><p>A source also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> at the time that Brady was “trying to figure out what to do” after he learned Bündchen had hired a divorce lawyer. A source also told Us Weekly at the time that Bündchen—who was “living apart” from Brady when she hired her divorce lawyer and had been “at odds” with her husband for months—was waiting for him to make a “big gesture” after he learned her thoughts about divorce were serious. “Gisele is waiting for Tom to make a big gesture of support to her,” the insider said. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> reported at the time that Tom and Gisele reached an agreement on their shared property and child custody. Though the settlement will remain confidential, a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> that the couple agreed on joint custody of their children. “The settlement is all worked out,”the insider said. “They’ve been working on the terms this whole time.” The source added, “They agreed to joint custody of the kids.”</p><p>A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Radar Online</a> in June 2022, that those close to Gisele encouraged her to update her prenup with Tom months before the couple separated. “The current prenup is pretty ironclad and lists how everything will be divided should they break up, but it needs to be updated and it can be if both parties agree,” the insider said at the time. The source continued, “Gisele is rich in her own right, but her friends are telling her she’d be nuts not to revise their prenup and she’s likely to listen to them.”</p><p>Attorney Sue Moss with Chemtob Moss Forman & Beyda LLP, who is not connected to the couple, also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in October 2022 that Bündchen and Brady’s different incomes could make their divorce complicated.&nbsp;“The big challenge for him is everything will be determined at the height of his income, because to get him to come back, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers had to come up with a lot of cash — and that is the baseline for determining the support in this case,” Moss said. “At the beginning, Gisele was earning more than him, and he kept on winning and his income got more and more substantial and it outgrew hers. And because of the timing, the case will be determined based upon the height of earnings.”</p><p>Divorce attorney Jacqueline Newman of Berkman Bottger Newman & Schein LLP, who is also not connected to the couple, also speculated to People that Brady and Bündchen signed a prenuptial agreement because of their high net worths. “People of this magnitude of wealth don’t generally get married without a document that’s going to dictate what’s going to happen if it doesn’t run its course,” Newman said. “My guess is that a lot of this is already worked out. So, there’s probably a prenuptial agreement that’s going to dictate a lot of this, but if there are some properties that were purchased while they were married — marital residences — there may be fights about that.” Newman continued, “There probably were assets that were acquired during the marriage, so there may be squabbles about that to say the least. That said, I think they are going to settle this, assuming they go forward with it — outside of the press.”</p><p>At the time they hired divorce lawyers, Brady and Bündchen owned at least four: a house at the Yellowstone Resort in Montana, a $3.5 million apartment in New York City, a home in Costa Rica; and the $17 million mansion tin Miami’s Indian Creek Island. While Brady and Bündchen’s finances are complicated, Newman speculated at the time that custody of their children could be more if an issue. “It really does seem that [Bündchen] has dedicated her life to these children,” Newman said. “I’m sure he is dedicated to the children, but he travels a lot. He’s not involved as much in the day to day. She may want more stability for them.” Newman continued, “The worst thing they could do is pull their kids through a custody battle.”</p><h2>Why did Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen divorce?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-1-2.jpg><p>Why did Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen divorce? A day before they filed for divorce, a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> on October 27, 2022, that Gisele gave Tom an ultimatum to choose their family or his NFL career with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. “Gisele told Tom either he leaves football to spend time with the family or she is gone for good,” the insider said. The source continued, “She doesn’t want him to continue to get injured and not be able to enjoy life in the future. She is doing it for her family.”</p><p>A week before the report, Tom confirmed at a press conference for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that he doesn’t plan to retire from the NFL any time soon. “I love the sport, I love the teammates, and I want to go do a good job for this team like I always have,” he said. “So, no retirement in my future,” he said at the time. Tom also discussed how his NFL career has affected his personal life in an episode on the<span class=s1><span class=s2>&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2><i>Let’s Go! with Tom Brady, Larry Fitzgerald and Jim Gray</i></span></a><span class=s2> podcast at the time. </span>“The reality is, you can really only be authentic to yourself,” he said. “I almost look at like a football season like you’re going away on deployment in the military. And it’s like, ‘Man, here I go again. There’s only one way to do it.’” He continued, “Whenever you may say, ‘Oh man, I want to make sure I spend a little more time doing this,’ your competitiveness takes over. And as much as you want to have this playful balance with the work balance, you’re going to end up doing exactly what you’ve always done. Which is why you are who you are. You’re going to go, ‘How do I get it done?’ You know, ‘What do I got to do to get it done?’”</span></p><p>He also confirmed in another episode of the podcast at the time that he doesn’t plan to quit the NFL after the 2022 season.&nbsp;“I’ve never quit on anything in my life,” Tom said. “I made a commitment to this team and I love this team and I love this organization.” Tom acknowledged there “was a retirement in the past,” however, “there’s no immediate retirement” in his future. “I’ve had nothing but a great experience here,” he said. “I want to keep fighting as hard as I can and I’m always trying to do better. I’m always trying to work hard and I’m always trying to commit more to the things that are important to me. And this team is very important to me and I certainly want to be the best I can be for them.”</p><p>According to a report by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> on October 7, 2022, Gisele had threatened to divorce Tom for years before their official separation. The insider claimed that all the arguments were over the same topic: football. Another source told People on October 7, 2022, “[The problems] are 10 years old,” the insider said of the couple. “This has been going on forever. This is nothing new to either of them.” Another source also told<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> People </a>at the time that Gisele is “done” with Tom and doesn’t think their relationship can be “repaired.” “She is done with their marriage,” an insider close to the model said. “She was upset about it for a long time and it’s still difficult, but she feels like she needs to move on. She doesn’t believe that her marriage can be repaired.” The source continued, “She is just trying to figure out her life. She doesn’t have much contact with Tom.” Other sources told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> that the two have separated before and that Gisele consulted a divorce attorney in 2015. One source said, “Tom and Gisele have separated before. Every couple of years they have a big fight and she has left Tom before, but she always came back. They always worked through things, and Tom was hopeful they would do it again this time.”</p><p>News of issues in Tom and Gisele’s relationship started in September 2022 when <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> reported the couple was in a “fight” over the NFL player’s decision to unretire from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in March 2022. (<a href=# rel=noopener>Tom announced his retirement</a> from the NFL after 22 years in February 2022 before <a href=# rel=noopener>reversing that decision</a> less than two months later.) “Tom and Gisele are in a fight right now,” a source told Page Six in September 2022. The insider added that there have been a “series of heated arguments” since Tom’s unretirement. A second source explained that Gisele’s issue with Tom’s decision to unretire is the lack of time he’ll spend with <a href=# rel=noopener>their children</a>: son Benjamin and daughter Vivian. Tom also shares son Jack with ex Bridget Moynahan. “There’s been trouble in the marriage over his decision to un-retire. Gisele has always been the one with the kids. They had agreed he would retire to focus on the family, then he changed his mind,” the insider said. A third source added, “They have a fiery relationship. Gisele is a bit hot-headed — she has that Brazilian heat!” The insider, however, added that Tom has always been a “family man,” regardless of if he’s in the NFL or not. “He’s such a doting dad, and very much a family man,” the source said.</p><p>The publication’s second source also claimed that Gisele has been working more—she’s currently the face of a new Burberry campaign—since Tom’s decision to unretire. “It’s almost like Gisele was like, ‘Well, if you’re going to keep playing, so will I,’” the insider said. “She’s resentful that Tom is still the football superstar.” A source also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in September 2022 that Gisele was “frustrated” with Tom and had “been spending time away from” him. “Going back to Tampa after the retirement put a strain on the personal side of his life,” the source said. “Gisele is frustrated and sick of his career coming before their family, who has always supported him.” The magazine also reported that Tom and Gisele spending time apart from each other “has happened before” and that the two are “trying” to make their relationship work. “There is a point Gisele believes that enough is enough,” a second source said. “[She has] always been an amazing wife, totally supporting Tom and his career and bringing the kids aboard.</p><p>A third source told People that Gisele is “not a stay-at-home mom.” The insider continued, “She has been working all along. She’s in N.Y.C. right now working, and the kids are enrolled in school in Florida.” The source also reported that Tom and Gisele had a “happy summer together” before NFL season and Gisele threw Tom “a big birthday party in Italy.” “He already announced his return to football this spring, so friends don’t understand why she’s upset now,” the insider said. “They’ve been very private about what’s really going on,” the source added. A fourth source also claimed to People that Gisele’s opinion on Tom’s unretirement had changed closer to NFL season. “It feels very different this year than last year,” the insider said. “She was excited to be here, we saw her around.” A source also confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> in September 2022 that there was “tension” between Tom and Gisele after he unretired from the NFL. “Gisele was not happy when Tom un-retired from the NFL after such a short time,” the insider said. “There is tension between them.” The source added that Tom is “doing everything he can to make it up to” Gisele. “They’re working through things and trying to come out the other side,” the source said.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> also reported in September 2022 that Gisele had moved out of her and Tom’s home in Tampa, Florida, and relocated to Costa Rica since their marital issues. “He’s very sad at the moment. Friends know they’ve had a serious disagreement this time,” a source said. “It seems that Gisele gets mad and says things like she’s leaving him, but in the past, they’ve always made up. But maybe this time it is more serious. He’s with the kids, and is just trying to be super dad.” Another source also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> a week later that Gisele had returned to Florida, but hadn’t moved back in with Tom yet. “Gisele isn’t back with Tom,” the insider said. “She flew back to Florida to be with her kids but hasn’t been to their home in Tampa.” The source continued, “Tom is still hoping they can reconcile. Gisele has told him she’s leaving him before, and they always made up when she cooled down.”</p><h2></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lessons-Gisele-Bundchen.jpg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$13.46</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$30.00</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>55% Off</span></p><p>For more about Gisele Bündchen, read her memoir, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Lessons</a>.
